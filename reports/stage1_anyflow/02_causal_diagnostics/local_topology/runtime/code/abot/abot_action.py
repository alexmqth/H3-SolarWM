"""ABot-World-Explorer action labels -> a conditioning tensor on the MiniMax-H3
latent timeline.

Same idea as the V-Rising version of this file, but with three real
differences, all found empirically:

1. **The four `delta_*` vectors in `action.json` are all zero** (100% zero
   across a 296-clip sample). The continuous motion signal has to be
   recovered from COLMAP's `sparse/0/images.txt` instead.
   Pose coverage is 1800/1800 = 100%, one pose per frame.

2. **COLMAP's scale is arbitrary per episode.** Holding only W, the
   per-frame displacement median spans 0.0045 to 0.1488 across 40 sampled
   episodes (33x). So translation must be **normalized per episode**;
   rotation is an angle and has no scale problem.

3. **No `resample_to_video_timeline` needed.** The V-Rising side has an
   81-frame @16fps sidecar against a video resampled to 107 frames @24fps,
   which needs a resampling step. Here we cut both the video and the action
   with the same explicit frame-index list at slicing time, so the two are
   frame-aligned by construction; `LoadVideo` reads it back as the identity
   mapping (verified: zero duplicate frames).

Channel layout (`ACTION_DIM = 17`):

    0..10   11 binary keys, amax within the window
    11..13  rotation deltas pitch/yaw/roll, degrees, summed within the
            window, then divided by ROT_SCALE
    14..16  translation deltas (x right, y down, z forward) in the previous
            frame's camera frame, already normalized per episode, summed
            within the window, then divided by TRA_SCALE

Why amax for binary and sum for continuous: a key press is a pulse — if it
was held anywhere in the window it counts as held, and averaging would
dilute it into a meaningless 0.25-style intensity. A delta is an additive
physical quantity — a latent token spanning 4 frames should get the total
displacement over those 4 frames. Note H3's frame grouping is non-uniform
(1,4,4,4,4): the first token in each group only spans 1 frame, so its sum
is naturally 1/4 of the others'. That's real information (the token really
does represent only 1 frame), not an artifact to smooth away.
