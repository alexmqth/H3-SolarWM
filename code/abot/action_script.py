"""Rule table mapping actions to per-latent text annotations.

Hand-written rules, not a VLM: deterministic, reproducible, zero cost, and
can be generated in real time at inference (a hard requirement for the
streaming case).

The template is a fixed sentence shape with two slots:

    the man <how he moves>, camera <how the view moves>

**The camera clause is generated from COLMAP's measured d_yaw / d_pitch, not
from the IJKL keys.** This is the one place in the whole scheme that can
genuinely add information: if all three clauses were derived from the same
8 bits, this would just be a one-hot encoding spelled out in English (which
is what an Action-Index baseline does).

Thresholds come from measured percentiles over the first 600 clips of the
7872-clip training set (after pooling to the latent grid):

    d_yaw   |v| p50=0.145  p70=0.526  p85=0.945  p95=1.076  (ROT_CLIP caps at 3.0)
    d_pitch |v| p50=0.006  p70=0.020  p85=0.229  p95=0.710

Sign convention verified empirically: J = turn left -> yaw positive,
L = turn right -> yaw negative.
